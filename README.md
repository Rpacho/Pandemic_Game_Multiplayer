## Game Summary

The game is about Coronavirus. There will be 2 players playing at the same time trying to stop 
the Coronavirus from spreading out to the community. The goal is to isolate all infected patient 
in the amount of time, which is enough for the researchers to find the vaccine. If all citizen in 
that city get infected then Game Over, if the players affected by the virus they have to self-isolate 
at base for 14 seconds to recover or else they’ll die and Game Over. There is a base for players to refill equipment 
and self-isolate. The players can be infected by the virus, they have to wash their hand before going 
back to base, drink water every 15 seconds to reduce the change of getting infected. Players will have
to search around the city to find the patient with Corona virus. The patient will only start sneezing 
after 14 seconds of contacting the virus, the players don’t know the exact location of patient because
they’re always moving. Players have to shoot the face mask to patient to prevent them from sneezing 
to others. They only have a limited amount of face mask, so they have to use them wisely; they can 
refill the face mask by collecting the face mask at the based.

## Game Objective

Players need to minimize the infected patient for 6 minutes. With a population of 300 
(might change later on) people, if all of them survive at the end of time limit, then 
the objective is complete with 5 star completion. At the end of the game, the star 
completion will be given based on how many people survive.

## Game Mode

The virus will spread around the city. If the npc’s virus bar is filled, they will get 
infected. Players will drive around the city and throw a face mask at npc to stop filling 
the npc’s virus bar. For the npc who got infected, the player will have to transport them 
to the hospital to get them treatment. In order for npc to recover, they need to wait for 
20 seconds at the hospital and consume 1 sanitizer. The npc who got recovered will be immune 
to the virus. Npc could die on the street if the player didn’t give it proper treatment, and 
it also could die at the hospital if it ran out of sanitizer. Players must refill the sanitizer 
at the hospital. The player could also get infected when the player’s virus bar is filled. 
In order to avoid that, players need to wash their hands. When a player gets infected, other 
players can help them get treatment.
